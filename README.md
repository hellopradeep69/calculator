# 🎉 Java Calculator Project

Welcome to the **Java Calculator Project**! 🧮✨  
This is a simple, interactive, console-based calculator built with Java. It supports **addition, subtraction, multiplication, division**, and has a **looping menu** for continuous operations. Perfect for beginners learning Java, OOP concepts, and console input handling.  

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Addition** – Add two numbers.  
- ✅ **Subtraction** – Subtract two numbers.  
- ✅ **Multiplication** – Multiply two numbers.  
- ✅ **Division** – Divide two numbers (with zero-check).  
- ✅ **Looping menu** – Perform multiple operations until you choose to quit.  
- ✅ **Input validation** – Handles invalid menu choices gracefully.  
- ✅ **Single Scanner** – Efficient input handling.

## 💡 Code Structure

```
calculator/
│
├─ Main.java             # Main program and looping menu
├─ Addition.java         # Handles addition
├─ Subtraction.java      # Handles subtraction
├─ Multiplication.java   # Handles multiplication
└─ Division.java         # Handles division with zero-check
```

* **Each operation is encapsulated in its own class** – good practice for learning OOP.
* The `Main` class uses **switch-case** and a **do-while loop** for interactive menu handling.

---

## 🔧 Future Improvements

* Add **decimal/floating point operations**.
* Implement **modulus, exponentiation, or square root** operations.
* Add **history tracking** of previous calculations.
* Build a **GUI version** using Java Swing or JavaFX.

---

## 📖 Learning Points

* Java basics: classes, objects, methods, variables.
* Scanner for console input.
* Loops (`do-while`) and conditional statements (`switch-case`).
* Good OOP practices: separating functionality into different classes.

---

## 😎 Fun Facts

* This calculator can **run endlessly** until you choose to quit – perfect for procrastination! 🕹️
* You can rename operation classes to **anything fun** – `Adderator`, `Subtronic`, `Multimagic`, `Divinator`… get creative! 🎨

If you want, I can also **add emojis, colored badges, and a fun ASCII art header** to make it **really eye-catching on GitHub**.  

Do you want me to do that?
